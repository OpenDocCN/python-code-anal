Note: This version has lines and columns numbers to help you with choosing the cell
to move from and to, so you don't have to continually count. It also puts a "." only for
blank cells you can move to, which I think makes for a more pleasing look and makes
it easier to play. If you want the original behavior, start the program with an arg
of "-o" for the original behavior.

This version preserves the underlying algorithms and functionality of
the original while using more modern programming constructs
(functions, classes, symbols) and providing much more detailed
comments.  It also fixes some (but not all) of the bugs.

### Chemist

The fictitious chemical, kryptocyanic acid, can only be diluted by the ratio of 7 parts water to 3 parts acid. Any other ratio causes an unstable compound which soon explodes. Given an amount of acid, you must determine how much water to add to the dilution. If you’re more than 5% off, you lose one of your nine lives. The program continues to play until you lose all nine lives or until it is interrupted.

It was originally written by Wayne Teeter of Ridgecrest, California.

### Chief

In the words of the program author, John Graham, “CHIEF is designed to give people (mostly kids) practice in the four operations (addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division).

It does this while giving people some fun. And then, if the people are wrong, it shows them how they should have done it.

CHIEF was written by John Graham of Upper Brookville, New York.

### Lua porting notes

- I did not like the old Western movie language style in the game introduction
and decided to tone it down, even if this deviates from the original BASIC
version.

- The `craps_game` function contains the main game logic: it
  - prints the game credits and presents the intro question;
  - asks for the end result and computes the original numer;
  - calls `explain_solution` to print the various steps of the computation;
  - presents the outro question and prints a `bolt` if necessary.

- Added basic input validation to accept only valid integers for numeric input.

- Minor formatting edits (lowercase, punctuation).

- Any answer to a "yes or no" question is regarded as "yes" if the input line
starts with 'y' or 'Y', else no.

### Chomp

This program is an adaptation of a mathematical game originally described by Martin Gardner in the January 1973 issue of _Scientific American_. Up to a 9x9 grid is set up by you with the upper left square in a poison square. This grid is the cookie. Players alternately chomp away at the cookie from the lower right. To take a chomp, input a row and column number of one of the squares remaining on the cookie. All of the squares below and to the right of that square, including that square, disappear.

Any number of people can play — the computer is only the moderator; it is not a player. Two-person strategies are interesting to work out but strategies when three or more people are playing are the real challenge.

The computer version of the game was written by Peter Sessions of People’s Computer Company.

### Civil War

This simulation is based on 14 battles in the Civil War. Facts and figures are based on the actual occurrence. If you follow the same strategy used in the actual battle, the results will be the same. Generally, this is a good strategy since the generals in the Civil War were fairly good military strategists. However, you can frequently outperform the Civil War generals, particularly in cases where they did not have good enemy intelligence and consequently followed a poor course of action. Naturally, it helps to know your Civil War history, although the computer gives you the rudiments.

After each of the 14 battles, your casualties are compared to the actual casualties of the battle, and you are told whether you win or lose the battle.

You may play Civil War alone in which case the program simulates the Union general. Or two players may play in which case the computer becomes the moderator.

Civil War was written in 1968 by three Students in Lexington High School, Massachusetts: L. Cram, L. Goodie, and D. Hibbard. It was modified into a 2-player game by G. Paul and R. Hess of TIES, St. Paul, Minnesota.

#### Known Bugs

- At the end of a single-player game, the program reports strategies used by "THE SOUTH", but these are in fact strategies used by the North (the computer player) -- the South is always a human player.

### Combat

In this game, you are fighting a small-scale war with the computer. You have 72,000 troops which you first ust distribute among your Army, Navy, and Air Force. You may distribute them in any way you choose as long as you don’t use more than 72,000.

You then attack your opponent (the computer) and input which service and the number of men you wish to use. The computer then tells you the outcome of the battle, gives you the current statistics and allows you to determine your next move.

After the second battle, it is decided from the total statistics whether you win or lose or if a treaty is signed.

This program was created by Bob Dores of Milton, Massachusetts.

#### Known Bugs

- The original game misspells "unguarded" on line 1751.
- In an initial army attack, the program claims that the computer loses 2/3 of its army, but it actually loses its entire army (lines 150-155).

The original BASIC code has a surprising number of bugs for such a small program.
For the sake of preserving the original behaviour, I've left them in place and
commented the ones I noticed.

### Craps

This game simulates the game of craps played according to standard Nevada craps table rules. That is:
1. A 7 or 11 on the first roll wins
2. A 2, 3, or 12 on the first roll loses
3. Any other number rolled becomes your “point.”
    - You continue to roll, if you get your point, you win.
    - If you roll a 7, you lose and the dice change hands when this happens.

This version of craps was modified by Steve North of Creative Computing. It is based on an original which appeared one day on a computer at DEC.

#### Porting Notes

    15 LET R=0

`R` is a variable that tracks winnings and losings.  Unlike other games that
start out with a lump sum of cash to spend this game assumes the user has as
much money as they want and we only track how much they lost or won.

      21 LET T=1
      22 PRINT "PICK A NUMBER AND INPUT TO ROLL DICE";
      23 INPUT Z
      24 LET X=(RND(0))
      25 LET T =T+1
      26 IF T<=Z THEN 24

This block of code does nothing other than try to scramble the random number
generator. Random number generation is not random, they are generated from the
previous generated number. Because of the slow speed of these systems back then,
gaming random number generators was a concern, mostly for gameplay quality.
If you could know the "seed value" to the generator then you could effectively
know how to get the exact same dice rolls to happen and change your bet to
maximize your winnings and minimize your losses.

The first reason this is an example of bad coding practice is the user is asked
to input a number but no clue is given as to the use of this number. This number
has no bearing on the game and as we'll see only has bearing on the internal
implementation of somehow trying to get an un-game-able seed for the random number
generator (since all future random numbers generated are based off this seed value.)

The `RND(1)` command generates a number from a seed value that is always
the same, everytime, from when the machine is booted up (old C64 behavior). In
order to avoid the same dice rolls being generated, a special call to `RND(-TI)`
would initialize the random generator with something else. But RND(-TI) is not
a valid command on all systems. So `RND(0)`, which generates a random number
from the system clock is used. But technically this could be gamed because the
system clock was driven by the bootup time, there wasn't a BIOS battery on these
systems that kept an internal real time clock going even when the system was
turned off, unlike your regular PC. Therefore, in order to ensure as true
randomness as possible, insert human reaction time by asking for human input.

But a human could just be holding down the enter key on bootup and that would
just skip any kind of multi-millisecond variance assigned by a natural human
reaction time. So, paranoia being a great motivator, a number is asked of the
user to avoid just holding down the enter key which negates the timing variance
of a human reaction.

What comes next is a bit of nonsense. The block of code loops a counter, recalling
the `RND(0)` function (and thus reseeding it with the system clock value)
and then comparing the counter to the user's number input
in order to bail out of the loop. Because the `RND(0)` function is based off the
system clock and the loop of code has no branching other than the bailout
condition, the loop also takes a fixed amount of time to execute, thus making
repeated calls to `RND(0)` predictive and this scheming to get a better random
number is pointless. Furthermore, the loop is based on the number the user inputs
so a huge number like ten million causes a very noticable delay and leaves the
user wondering if the program has errored. The author could have simply called
`RND(0)` once and used a prompt that made more sense like asking for the users
name and then using that name in the game's replies.

It is advised that you use whatever your languages' random number generator
provides and simply skip trying to recreate this bit of nonsense including
the user input.

      27 PRINT"INPUT THE AMOUNT OF YOUR WAGER.";
      28 INPUT F
      30 PRINT "I WILL NOW THROW THE DICE"
      40 LET E=INT(7*RND(1))
      41 LET S=INT(7*RND(1))
      42 LET X=E+S
      .... a bit later ....
      60 IF X=1 THEN 40
      65 IF X=0 THEN 40

`F` is a variable that represents the users wager for this betting round.
`E` and `S` represent the two individual and random dice being rolled.
This code is actually wrong because it returns a value between 0 and 6.
`X` is the sum of these dice rolls. As you'll see though further down in the
code, if `X` is zero or one it re-rolls the dice to maintain a potential
outcome of the sum of two dice between 2 and 12. This skews the normal distribution
of dice values to favor lower numbers because it does not consider that `E`
could be zero and `S` could be 2 or higher. To show this skewing of values
you can run the `distribution.bas` program which creates a histogram of the
distribution of the bad dice throw code and proper dice throw code.

Here are the results:

      DISTRIBUTION OF DICE ROLLS WITH  INT(7*RND(1))  VS  INT(6*RND(1)+1)
      THE INT(7*RND(1)) DISTRIBUTION:
      2             3             4             5             6             7             8             9             10            11            12
      6483          8662          10772         13232         15254         13007         10746         8878          6486          4357          2123
      THE INT(6*RND(1)+1) DISTRIBUTION
      2             3             4             5             6             7             8             9             10            11            12
      2788          5466          8363          11072         13947         16656         13884         11149         8324          5561          2790
If the dice rolls are fair then we should see the largest occurrence be a 7 and
the smallest should be 2 and 12. Furthermore the occurrences should be
symetrical meaning there should be roughly the same amount of 2's as 12's, the
same amount of 3's as 11's, 4's as 10's and so on until you reach the middle, 7.
But notice in the skewed dice roll, 6 is the most rolled number not 7, and the
rest of the numbers are not symetrical, there are many more 2's than 12's.
So the lesson is test your code.

The proper way to model a dice throw, in almost every language is
    `INT(6*RND(1)+1)` or `INT(6*RND(1))+1`

SideNote: `X` was used already in the
previous code block discussed but its value was never used. This is another
poor coding practice: **Don't reuse variable names for different purposes.**

      50 IF X=7 THEN 180
      55 IF X=11 THEN 180
      60 IF X=1 THEN 40
      62 IF X=2 THEN 195
      65 IF X=0 THEN 40
      70 IF X=2 THEN 200
      80 IF X=3 THEN 200
      90 IF X=12 THEN 200
      125 IF X=5 THEN 220
      130 IF X =6 THEN 220
      140 IF X=8 THEN 220
      150 IF X=9 THEN 220
      160 IF X =10 THEN 220
      170 IF X=4 THEN 220

This bit of code determines the routing of where to go for payout, or loss.
Of course, line 60 and 65 are pointless as we've just shown and should be removed
as long as the correct dice algorithm is also changed.

      62 IF X=2 THEN 195
      ....
      70 IF X=2 THEN 200
The check for a 2 has already been made and the jump is done. Line 70 is
therefore redundant and can be left out. The purpose of line 62 is only to
print a special output, "SNAKE EYES!" which we'll see in the next block creates
duplicate code.

Lines 125-170 are also pointlessly checked because we know previous values have
been ruled out, only these last values must remain, and they are all going to
the same place, line 220. Line 125-170 could have simply been replaced with
`GOTO 220`



      180 PRINT X "- NATURAL....A WINNER!!!!"
      185 PRINT X"PAYS EVEN MONEY, YOU WIN"F"DOLLARS"
      190 GOTO 210
      195 PRINT X"- SNAKE EYES....YOU LOSE."
      196 PRINT "YOU LOSE"F "DOLLARS."
      197 LET F=0-F
      198 GOTO 210
      200 PRINT X " - CRAPS...YOU LOSE."
      205 PRINT "YOU LOSE"F"DOLLARS."
      206 LET F=0-F
      210 LET R= R+F
      211 GOTO 320

This bit of code manages instant wins or losses due to 7,11 or 2,3,12. As
mentioned previously, lines 196 and 197 are essentially the same as lines
205 and 206. A simpler code would be just to jump after printing the special
message of "SNAKE EYES!" to line 205.

Lines 197 and 206 just negate the wager by subtracting it from zero. Just saying
`F = -F` would have sufficed. Line 210 updates your running total of winnings
or losses with this bet.

      220 PRINT X "IS THE POINT. I WILL ROLL AGAIN"
      230 LET H=INT(7*RND(1))
      231 LET Q=INT(7*RND(1))
      232 LET O=H+Q
      240 IF O=1 THEN 230
      250 IF O=7 THEN 290
      255 IF O=0 THEN 230

This code sets the point, the number you must re-roll to win without rolling
a 7, the most probable number to roll. Except in this case again, it has the
same incorrect dice rolling code and therefore 6 is the most probable number
to roll. The concept of DRY (don't repeat yourself) is a coding practice which
encourages non-duplication of code because if there is an error in the code, it
can be fixed in one place and not multiple places like in this code. The scenario
might be that a programmer sees some wrong code, fixes it, but neglects to
consider that there might be duplicates of the same wrong code elsewhere.  If
you practice DRY then you never worry much about behaviors in your code diverging
due to duplicate code snippets.

      260 IF O=X THEN 310
      270 PRINT O " - NO POINT. I WILL ROLL AGAIN"
      280 GOTO 230
      290 PRINT O "- CRAPS. YOU LOSE."
      291 PRINT "YOU LOSE $"F
      292 F=0-F
      293 GOTO 210
      300 GOTO 320
      310 PRINT X"- A WINNER.........CONGRATS!!!!!!!!"
      311 PRINT X "AT 2 TO 1 ODDS PAYS YOU...LET ME SEE..."2*F"DOLLARS"
      312 LET F=2*F
      313 GOTO 210

This is the code to keep rolling until the point is made or a seven is rolled.
Again we see the negated `F` wager and lose message duplicated. This code could
have been reorganized using a subroutine, or in BASIC, the GOSUB command, but
in your language its most likely just known as a function or method. You can
do a `grep -r 'GOSUB'` from the root directory to see other BASIC programs in
this set that use GOSUB.

The rest of the code if fairly straight forward, replay the game or end with
a report of your winnings or losings.

### Lua porting notes

-  The `craps_main` function contains the main game loop, which iteratively
plays craps rounds by calling `play_round` and tracks winnings and losings.
- Replaced the original routine that tries to scramble the random number
generator with a proper seed initializer in Lua: `math.randomseed(os.time())`
(as advised in the general porting notes). 
- Added basic input validation to accept only positive integers for the
wager and the answer to the "If you want to play again print 5" question.
- "If you want to play again print 5 if not print 2" reads a bit odd but
we decided to leave it as is and stay true to the BASIC original version.

### Cube

CUBE is a game played on the facing sides of a cube with a side dimension of 2. A location is designated by three numbers — e.g., 1, 2, 1. The object is to travel from 1, 1, 1 to 3, 3, 3 by moving one horizontal or vertical (not diagonal) square at a time without striking one of 5 randomly placed landmines. You are staked to $500; prior to each play of the game you may make a wager whether you will reach your destination. You lose if you hit a mine or try to make an illegal move — i.e., change more than one digit from your previous position.

Cube was created by Jerimac Ratliff of Fort Worth, Texas.

#### Porting Notes

(please note any difficulties or challenges in porting here)

##### Known Bugs

This program does very little validation of its input, enabling the user to cheat in two ways:
- One can enter a large negative wager, purposely lose, and gain that much money.
- One can move outside the cube (using coordinates 0 or 4), then safely walk "around" the standard play volume to the destination square.

It's remotely possible that these are clever solutions the user is intended to find, solving an otherwise purely random game.

##### Randomization Logic

The BASIC code uses an interesting technique for choosing the random coordinates for the mines. The first coordinate is
chosen like this:

```basic
380 LET A=INT(3*(RND(X)))
390 IF A<>0 THEN 410
400 LET A=3
```

where line 410 is the start of a similar block of code for the next coordinate. The behaviour of `RND(X)` depends on the
value of `X`. If `X` is greater than zero then it returns a random value between 0 and 1. If `X` is zero it returns the
last random value generated, or 0 if no value has yet been generated.

If `X` is 1, therefore, the first line above set `A` to 0, 1, or 2. The next 2 lines replace a 0 with a 3. The
replacement values varies for the different coordinates with the result that the random selection is biased towards a
specific set of points. If `X` is 0, the `RND` calls all return 0, so the coordinates are the known. It appears that
this technique was probably used to allow testing the game with a well-known set of locations for the mines. However, in
the code as it comes to us, the value of `X` is never set and is thus 0, so the mine locations are never randomized.

The C# port implements the biased randomized mine locations, as seems to be the original intent, but includes a
command-line switch to enable the deterministic execution as well.

Conversion to [Microsoft C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)

#### Execution

As noted in the main Readme file, the randomization code in the BASIC program has a switch (the variable `X`) that
allows the game to be run in a deterministic (non-random) mode.

Running the C# port without command-line parameters will play the game with random mine locations.

Running the port with a `--non-random` command-line switch will run the game with non-random mine locations.

### Depth Charge

In this program you are captain of the destroyer USS Computer. An enemy submarine has been causing trouble and your mission is to destroy it. You may select the seize of the “cube” of water you wish to search in. The computer then determines how many depth charges you get to destroy the submarine.

Each depth charge is exploded by you specifying a trio of numbers; the first two are the surface coordinates (X,Y), the third is the depth. After each depth charge, your sonar observer will tell you where the explosion was relative to the submarine.

Dana Noftle wrote this program while a student at Acton High School, Acton, Massachusetts.

## Conversion

Not a difficult conversion - but a chance to throw in a few ways
Perl makes life easy.

 * To get the sub permission which is a random location in the g x g x g grid we can use:
   * assigning multiple variables in list form ($a,$b,$c) = (?,?,?)
   * where the list on the right hand side is generated with a map function

 * We use ternarys to generate the message if you miss the sub.
   * We use join to stitch the pieces of the string together.
   * If we have a ternary where we don't want to return anything we return an empty list rather than an empty string - if you return the latter you still get the padding spaces.

### Diamond

This program fills an 8.5x11 piece of paper with diamonds (plotted on a hard-copy terminal, of course). The program asks for an odd number to be input in the range 5 to 31. The diamonds printed will be this number of characters high and wide. The number of diamonds across the page will vary from 12 for 5-character wide diamonds to 1 for a diamond 31-characters wide. You can change the content of the pattern if you wish.

The program was written by David Ahl of Creative Computing.

### Dice

Not exactly a game, this program simulates rolling a pair of dice a large number of times and prints out the frequency distribution. You simply input the number of rolls. It is interesting to see how many rolls are necessary to approach the theoretical distribution:

|   |      |            |
|---|------|------------|
| 2 | 1/36 | 2.7777...% |
| 3 | 2/36 | 5.5555...% |
| 4 | 3/36 | 8.3333...% |
etc.

Daniel Freidus wrote this program while in the seventh grade at Harrison Jr-Sr High School, Harrison, New York.

### Porting notes for Lua

- This is a straightfoward port with only minor modifications for input
validation and text formatting.

- The "Try again?" question accepts 'y', 'yes', 'n', 'no' (case insensitive),
whereas the original BASIC version defaults to no unless 'YES' is typed.

- The "How many rolls?" question presents a more user friendly message
in case of invalid input.

### Digits

The player writes down a set of 30 numbers (0, 1, or 2) at random prior to playing the game. The computer program, using pattern recognition techniques, attempts to guess the next number in your list.

The computer asks for 10 numbers at a time. It always guesses first and then examines the next number to see if it guessed correctly. By pure luck (or chance or probability), the computer ought to be right 10 times. It is uncanny how much better it generally does than that!

This program originated at Dartmouth; original author unknown.

#### Porting Notes

- The program contains a lot of mysterious and seemingly arbitrary constants.  It's not clear there is any logic or rationality behind it.
- The key equation involved in the guess (line 700) involves a factor of `A`, but `A` is always 0, making that term meaningless.  As a result, all the work to build and update array K and value Z2 appear to be meaningless, too.

### Even Wins

This is a game between you and the computer. To play, an odd number of objects (marbles, chips, matches) are placed in a row. You take turns with the computer picking up between one and four objects each turn. The game ends when there are no objects left, and the winner is the one with an even number of objects picked up.

Two versions of this game are included. While to the player they appear similar, the programming approach is quite different. EVEN WINS, the first version, is deterministic — i.e., the computer plays by fixed, good rules and is impossible to beat if you don’t know how to play the game. It always starts with 27 objects, although you may change this.

The second version, GAME OF EVEN WINS, is much more interesting because the computer starts out only knowing the rules of the game. Using simple techniques of artificial intelligence (cybernetics), the computer gradually learns to play this game from its mistakes until it plays a very good game. After 20 games, the computer is a challenge to beat. Variation in the human’s style of play seems to make the computer learn more quickly. If you plot the learning curve of this program, it closely resembles classical human learning curves from psychological experiments.

Eric Peters at DEC wrote the GAME OF EVEN WINS. The original author of EVEN WINS is unknown.

### Flip Flop

The object of this game is to change a row of ten X’s

```
X X X X X X X X X X
```

to a row of ten 0’s

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

by typing in a number corresponding to the position of an “X” in the line. On some numbers one position will change while on other numbers, two will change. For example, inputting a 3 may reverse the X and 0 in position 3, but it might possibly reverse some of other position too! You ought to be able to change all 10 in 12 or fewer moves. Can you figure out a good winning strategy?

To reset the line to all X’s (same game), type 0 (zero). To start a new game at any point, type 11.

The original author of this game was Micheal Kass of New Hyde Park, New York.

### Football

Football is probably the most popular simulated sports game. I have seen some people play to elect to play computerized football in preference to watching a football game on television.

Two versions of football are presented. The first is somewhat “traditional” in that you, the player, are playing against the computer. You have a choice of seven offensive plays. On defense the computer seems to play a zone defence, but you have no choice of plays. The computer program presents the necessary rules as you play, and it is also the referee and determines penalties when an infraction is committed. FTBALL was written by John Kemeny at Dartmouth.

IN the second version of football, the computer referees a game played between two human players. Each player gets a list of twenty plays with a code value for each one. This list should be kept confidential from your opponent. The codes can be changes in data. All twenty plays are offensive; a defensive play is specified by defending against a type of offensive play. A defense is good for other similar types of plays, for example, a defense against a flare pass is very good against a screen pass but much less good against a half-back option.

This game was originally written by Raymond Miseyka of Butler, Pennsylvania.

### Fur Trader

You are the leader of a French fur trading expedition in 1776 leaving the Ontario area to sell furs and get supplies for the next year. You have a choice of three forts at which you may trade. The cost of supplies and the amount you recieve for your furs will depend upon the fort you choose. You also specify what types of furs that you have to trade.

The game goes on and on until you elect to trade no longer.

Author of the program is Dan Bachor, University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

- The value of some furs are not changed from the previous fort when you select fort 2 or 3.  As a result, you will get a different value for your firs depending on whether you have previously visited a different fort.  (All fur values are set when you visit Fort 1.)

##### Translator Notes:
I tried to preserve as much of the original layout and flow of the code
as possible.  However I did use enumerated types for the Fort numbers
and Fur types.  I think this was certainly a change for the better, and
makes the code much easier to read.

I also tried to minimise the use of pointers, and stuck with old-school
C formatting, because you never know how old the compiler is.

Interestingly the code seems to have a bug around the prices of Fox Furs.
The commodity-rate for these is stored in the variable `D1`, however some
paths through the code do not set this price.  So there was a chance of
using this uninitialised, or whatever the previous loop set.  I don't
think this was the original authors intent.  So I preserved the original flow
of the code (using the previous `D1` value), but also catching the
uninitialised path, and assigning a "best guess" value.

##### Translator Notes:
I tried to preserve as much of the original layout and flow of the code
as possible.  However I did use quasi enumerated types for the Fort numbers
and Fur types.  I think this was certainly a change for the better, and
makes the code much easier to read.

I program in many different languages on a daily basis.  Most languages
require brackets around expressions, so I just cannot bring myself to
write an expression without brackets.  IMHO it makes the code easier to study,
but it does contravene the Python PEP-8 Style guide.

### Golf

This is a single player golf game. In other words it’s you against the golf course (the computer). The program asks for your handicap (maximum of 30) and your area of difficulty. You have a bag of 29 clubs plus a putter. On the course you have to contend with rough, trees, on and off fairway, sand traps, and water hazards. In addition, you can hook, slice, go out of bounds, or hit too far. On putting, you determine the potency factor (or percent of swing). Until you get the swing of the game (no pun intended), you’ll probably was to use a fairly high handicap.

Steve North of Creative Computing modified the original version of this game, the author of which is unknown.

#### Known Bugs

- The weakness numbers printed in the original BASIC program are wrong.  It says 4=TRAP SHOTS, 5=PUTTING, but in the code, trap shots and putting are 3 and 4, respectively.
