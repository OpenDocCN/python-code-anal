### Gomoko

GOMOKO or GOMOKU is a traditional game of the Orient. It is played by two people on a board of intersecting lines (19 left-to-right lines, 19 top-to-bottom lines, 361 intersections in all). Players take turns. During his turn, a player may cover one intersection with a marker; (one player uses white markers; the other player uses black markers). The object of the game is to get five adjacent markers in a row, horizontally, vertically or along either diagonal.

Unfortunately, this program does not make the computer a very good player. It does not know when you are about to win or even who has won. But some of its moves may surprise you.

The original author of this program is Peter Sessions of People’s Computer Company.

### Guess

In Program GUESS, the computer chooses a random integer between 0 and any limit you set. You must then try to guess the number the computer has chosen using the clues provided by the computer.

You should be able to guess the number in one less than the number of digits needed to represent the number in binary notation — i.e., in base 2. This ought to give you a clue as to the optimum search technique.

GUESS converted from the original program in FOCAL which appeared in the book “Computers in the Classroom” by Walt Koetke of Lexington High School, Lexington, Massachusetts.

### Gunner

GUNNER allows you to adjust the fire of a field artillery weapon to hit a stationary target. You specify the number of degrees of elevation of your weapon; 45 degrees provides maximum range with values under or over 45 degrees providing less range.

You get up to five shots to destroy the enemy before he destroys you. Gun range varies between 20,000 and 60,000 yards and burst radius is 100 yards. You must specify elevation within approximately 0.2 degrees to get a hit.

Tom Kloos of the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry in Portland, Oregon originally wrote GUNNER. Extensive modifications were added by David Ahl.

### Hammurabi

In this game you direct the administrator of Sumeria, Hammurabi, how to manage the city. The city initially has 1,000 acres, 100 people and 3,000 bushels of grain in storage.

You may buy and sell land with your neighboring city-states for bushels of grain — the price will vary between 17 and 26 bushels per acre. You also must use grain to feed your people and as seed to plant the next year’s crop.

You will quickly find that a certain number of people can only tend a certain amount of land and that people starve if they are not fed enough. You also have the unexpected to contend with such as a plague, rats destroying stored grain, and variable harvests.

You will also find that managing just the few resources in this game is not a trivial job over a period of say ten years. The crisis of population density rears its head very rapidly.

This program was originally written in Focal at DEC; author unknown. David Ahl converted it to BASIC and added the 10-year performance assessment. If you wish to change any of the factors, the extensive remarks in the program should make modification fairly straightforward.

Note for trivia buffs: somewhere along the line an m was dropped out of the spelling of Hammurabi in hte Ahl version of the computer program. This error has spread far and wide until a generation of students now think that Hammurabi is the incorrect spelling.

### Hangman

This is a simulation of the word guessing game, hangman. The computer picks a word, tells you how many letters in the word it has picked and then you guess a letter in the word. If you are right, the computer tells you where that letter belongs; if your letter is wrong, the computer starts to hang you. You get ten guesses before you are completely hanged:
1. Head
2. Body
3. Right Arm
4. Left Arm
5. Right Leg
6. Left Leg
7. Right Hand
8. Left Hand
9. Right Foot
10. Left Foot

You may add words in Data statements; however if you do, you must also change the random word selector.

David Ahl modified this program into its current form from the one created by Kenneth Aupperle of Melville, New York.

### Hello

This is a sample of one of the great number of conversational programs. In a sense, it is like a CAI program except that its responses are just good fun. Whenever a computer is exhibited at a convention or conference with people that have not used a computer before, the conversational programs seem to get the first activity.

In this particular program, the computer dispenses advice on various problems such as sex, health, money, or job.

David Ahl is the author of HELLO.

### Hexapawn

The game of Hexapawn and a method to learn a strategy for playing the game was described in Martin Gardner’s “Mathematical Games” column in the March 1962 issue of _Scientific American_. The method described in the article was for a hypothetical learning machine composed of match boxes and colored beads. This has been generalized in the program HEX.

The program learns by elimination of bad moves. All positions encountered by the program and acceptable moves from them are stored in an array. When the program encounters an unfamiliar position, the position and all legal moves from it are added to the list. If the program loses a game, it erases the move that led to defeat. If it hits a position from which all moves have been deleted (they all led to defeat), it erases the move that got it there and resigns. Eventually, the program learns to play extremely well and, indeed, is unbeatable. The learning strategy could be adopted to other simple games with a finite number of moves (tic-tac-toe, small board checkers, or other chess-based games).

The original version of this program was written by R.A. Kaapke. It was subsequently modified by Jeff Dalton and finally by Steve North of Creative Computing.

#### Known Bugs

- There are valid board positions that will cause the program to print "ILLEGAL BOARD PATTERN" and break.  For example: human 8,5; computer 1,5; human 9,5; computer 3,5; human 7,5.  This is a valid game-over pattern, but it is not detected as such because of incorrect logic in lines 240-320 (intended to detect whether the computer has any legal moves).

### Hi-Lo

This game is an adaptation of the game GUESS; however, instead of just guessing a number between 1 and 100, in this game you win dollars when you guess the number. The directions, in the words of the author, are as follows:
1. There is an amount of money, between one and one hundred dollars, in the “HI-LO” jackpot.
2. You will have six chances in which to guess the amount of money in the jackpot.
3. After each guess, the computer will tell whether the guess was too high or too low.
4. If the correct amount of money is not guessed after six chances, the computer will print the amount in the jackpot.
5. If the correct amount of money is guessed within the six chance limit, the computer will register this amount.
6. After each sequence of guesses, you have the choice of playing again or ending the program. If a new game is played, a new amount of money will constitute the jackpot.
7. If youwin more than once, then your earnings are totalled.

The author is Dean ALtman of Fort Worth, Texas.

### High IQ

This is a computerized version of an old European solitaire game of logic. The game starts with a pegboard shaped like a cross having pegs in every hole but the center. The object is to remove all 32 pegs, or as many as possible, by jumping into an empty hole, then removing the jumped peg.

There are several different winning strategies for playing, and of course, each strategy can be played eight different ways on the board. Can you find a consistent winner?

Charles Lund wrote this game while at The American School in The Hague, Netherlands.

## Running the code

Assuming the reference [dmd](https://dlang.org/download.html#dmd) compiler:
```shell
dmd -dip1000 -run highiq.d
```

[Other compilers](https://dlang.org/download.html) also exist.


## Discussion

The original BASIC game code made use of calculus and clever choises of field IDs to determine the validity of moves.
This is the original layout of IDs over the board:

```
          13   14   15

          22   23   24

29   30   31   32   33   34   35

38   39   40   41   42   43   44

47   48   49   50   51   52   53

          58   59   60

          67   68   69
```

This seems not very logical, because, wouldn't it make much more sense to let columns increase with 1 and rows increase
with 10, so you'd get a consistent coordinate system? It seems that the original author's first step in validating
moves was to check that moves jumped from one field over another one onto the next. He did this by making sure that
adjacent IDs alter between even and odd horizontally *and* vertically. So a valid move was always from an even ID to an
even ID *or* from an odd ID to an odd ID. So one of the checks that the BASIC code made was that the sum of both IDs
was even. This is of course not a sufficient test, because moves that jump over three fields are illegal. Therefore the
IDs seem to have been carefully laid oud so that the IDs increase with 1 horizontally, and 9 vertically, everywhere. So
the only valid difference between IDs for a horizontal move was always 2, and the only valid difference for a vertical
move was always 18.

Fact of the matter is, however, that checking for difference is sufficient and the even sum rule is superfluous, so
there is no need for the peculiar distribution of field IDs. Therefore I have chosen the following more logical
distribution:

```
          13   14   15

          23   24   25

31   32   33   34   35   36   37

41   42   43   44   45   46   47

51   52   53   54   55   56   57

          63   64   65

          73   74   75
```

As a consequence, the implementation of the game code has become much simpler; Not alone due to one less check, but due
to the fact that conversions between IDs and board coordinates have become unnecessary and thus we can work with a single
representation of the board state.

This version makes a prettier print of the board than the BASIC original, with coordinates for every move, and explains
illegal moves.

### Hockey

This is a simulation of a ice hockey game. The computer, in this case, moderates and referees the pay between two human opponents. Of course, one person could play both sides.

The program asks for team names, player names, and even the name of the referee. Four types of shot are permitted and a shot may be aimed at one of four areas. You are also asked about passing. The game is very comprehensive with lots of action, face offs, blocks, passes, 4 on 2 situations, and so on. Unfortunately there are no penalties.

The original author is Robert Puopolo; modifications by Steve North of Creative Computing.

#### Known Bugs

- An apparent missing line 430 causes the code to fall through from the "FLIPS A WRISTSHOT" case directly to the "BACKHANDS ONE" case.
- The author consistently misspells the verb "lets" (writing it like the contraction "let's"), while having no trouble with "leads", "gets", "hits", etc.

### Horserace

This program simulates a one-mile horse race for three-year old throughbreds. Up to ten people may place bets on the race up to $10,000 each. However, you may only bet to win. You place your bet by inputting the number of the horse, a comma, and the amount of your bet. The computer then shows the position of the horses at seven points around the track and at the finish. Payoffs and winnings are shown at the end.

The program was written by Laurie Chevalier while a student at South Portland High School.

### Hurkle

Hurkle? A Hurkle is a happy beast and lives in another galaxy on a planet named Lirht that has three moons. Hurkle are favorite pets of the Gwik, the dominant race of Lihrt and … well, to find out more, read “The Hurkle is a Happy Beast,” a story in the book _A Way Home_ by Theodore Sturgeon.

In this program a shy hurkle is hiding on a 10 by 10 grid. Homebase is point 0,0 in the _Southwest_ corner. Your guess as to the gridpoint where the hurkle is hiding should be a pair of whole numbers, separated by a comma. After each try, the computer will tell you the approximate direction to go look for the Hurkle. You get five guesses to find him; you may change this number, although four guesses is actually enough.

This program was written by Bob Albrecht of People’s Computer Company.

### Kinema

This program tests your fundamental knowledge of kinematics. It presents a simple problem: a ball is thrown straight up into the air at some random velocity. You then must answer three questions about the flight of the ball:
1. How high will it go?
2. How long until it returns to earth?
3. What will be its velocity after a random number of seconds?

The computer evaluates your performance; within 15% of the correct answer is considered close enough. After each run, the computer gives you another problem until you interrupt it.

KINEMA was shorted from the original Huntington Computer Project Program, KINERV, by Richard Pav of Patchogue High School, Patchogue, New York.

## King

This is one of the most comprehensive, difficult, and interesting games. (If you've never played one of these games, start with HAMMURABI.)

In this game, you are Premier of Setats Detinu, a small communist island 30 by 70 miles long. Your job is to decide upon the budget of your country and distribute money to your country from the communal treasury.

The money system is Rollods; each person needs 100 Rallods per year to survive. Your country's income comes from farm produce and tourists visiting your magnificent forests, hunting, fishing, etc. Part of your land is farm land but it also has an excellent mineral content and may be sold to foreign industry for strip mining. Industry import and support their own workers. Crops cost between 10 and 15 Rallods per square mile to plant, cultivate, and harvest. Your goal is to complete an eight-year term of office without major mishap. A word of warning: it isn't easy!

The author of this program is James A. Storer who wrote it while a student at Lexington High School.

⚠️ This game includes references to suicide or self-harm.

#### Porting Notes

Implementers should be aware that this game contains bugs.

### Bug 1

On basic line 1450

    1450 V3=INT(A+V3)
    1451 A=INT(A+V3)

...where A is the current treasury, and V3 is initially zero.
This would mean that the treasury doubles at the end of the first year, and all calculations for an increase in the treasury due to tourism are discarded.
Possibly, this made the game more playable, although impossible for the player to understand why the treasury was increasing?

A quick fix for this bug in the original code would be

    1450 V3=ABS(INT(V1-V2))
    1451 A=INT(A+V3)

...judging from the description of tourist income on basic line 1410

    1410 PRINT " YOU MADE";ABS(INT(V1-V2));"RALLODS FROM TOURIST TRADE."

### Bug 2

On basic line 1330 following was the variable T1 never assigned:

    1330 PRINT " YOU HARVESTED ";INT(J-U2);"SQ. MILES OF CROPS."
    1340 IF U2=0 THEN 1370
    1344 IF T1>=2 THEN 1370
    1350 PRINT "   (DUE TO ";
    1355 IF T1=0 THEN 1365
    1360 PRINT "INCREASED ";

Likely it should be the difference of the current years crop loss compared to the
last years crop loss.

### Bug 3

On basic line 1997 it is:

    1997 PRINT "   AND 10,000 SQ. MILES OF FOREST LAND."

but it should be:

    1997 PRINT "   AND 1,000 SQ. MILES OF FOREST LAND."

### Bug 4

On basic line 1310 we see this:

    1310 IF C=0 THEN 1324
    1320 PRINT "OF ";INT(J);"SQ. MILES PLANTED,";
    1324 ...

but it should probably be:

    1310 IF J=0 THEN 1324

### Bug 5

On basic line 1390 the income from tourism is calculated:

```
1390 A=INT(A+Q)
1400 V1=INT(((B-P1)*22)+(RND(1)*500))
1405 V2=INT((2000-D)*15)
1410 PRINT " YOU MADE";ABS(INT(V1-V2));"RALLODS FROM TOURIST TRADE."
```

It is very easily possible that `V2` is larger than `V1` e.g. if all of the land has been sold. In the original game this does not make a difference because of Bug 1 (see above).

However, judging by how `V1` and `V2` are handled in the code, it looks like `V1` is the basic income from tourism and `V2` is a deduction for pollution. When `ABS(INT(V1-V2))` is used as earnings from tourism, the player actually _gets_ money for a large enough pollution. So a better solution would be to let `V1 - V2` cap out at 0, so once the pollution is large enough, there is no income from tourists anymore.

Porting Notes
-------------

### Floats

The original code implicitly uses floating point numbers in many places which are explicitly cast to integers. In this port, I avoided using floats and tried to replicate the behaviour using just integers. It is possible that I missed some places where rounding a value would have made a difference. If you find such a bug, please notify me or make implement a fix yourself.

### Signed Numbers

I used unsigned integers for most of the program because it was easier than to check for negative values all the time. Unfortunately, that made the code a bit whacky in one or two places.

Since I only allow input of positive numbers, it is not possible to exit the game when entering the stats to resume a game, which would be possible by entering negative numbers in the original game.

### Bugs

I tried to fix all bugs listed in the [main README for King](../README.md). I have tested this implementation a bit but not extensively, so there may be some portation bugs. If you find them, you are free to fix them.

Future Development
------------------

I plan to add some tests and tidy up the code a bit, but this version should be feature-complete.

### Letter

LETTER is similar to the game GUESS in which you guess a number chosen by the computer; in this program, the computer picks a random letter of the alphabet and you must guess which one it is using the clues provided as you go along. It should not take you more than five guesses to get the mystery letter.

The program which appears here is loosely based on the original written by Bob Albrect of People’s Computer Company.
