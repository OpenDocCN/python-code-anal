/**
 * SPLAT simulates a parachute jump in which you try to open your parachute at the last possible moment without going
 * splat! You may select your own terminal velocity or let the computer do it for you. You many also select the
 * acceleration due to gravity or, again, let the computer do it in which case you might wind up on any of eight
 * planets (out to Neptune), the moon, or the sun.
 * <p>
 * The computer then tells you the height you’re jumping from and asks for the seconds of free fall. It then divides
 * your free fall time into eight intervals and gives you progress reports on your way down. The computer also keeps
 * track of all prior jumps in the array A and lets you know how you compared with previous successful jumps. If you
 * want to recall information from previous runs, then you should store array A in a disk or take file and read it
 * before each run.
 * <p>
 * John Yegge created this program while at the Oak Ridge Associated Universities.

 * Ported from BASIC by jason plumb (@breedx2)
