Conversion to [Perl](https://www.perl.org/)

Modified so that if the user enters "quit" or "stop" for the input, the program will exit.
This way the user doesn't have to enter Contorl-C to quit.

Target values can be space and/or comma separated, so "1 2 3" is valid, as is "1,2,3" or even "1, 2, 3".
I believe the original Basic program wanted "1,2,3" or else each on a separate line.
