Note: This version has lines and columns numbers to help you with choosing the cell
to move from and to, so you don't have to continually count. It also puts a "." only for
blank cells you can move to, which I think makes for a more pleasing look and makes
it easier to play. If you want the original behavior, start the program with an arg
of "-o" for the original behavior.
